    "APL does not recognise the function hierarchies of common mathematical notation, and with good reason. Mathematical notation determines its order by the kind of function, e.g. doing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. But this is true only for a few kinds of functions, which are respresented by special symbols. For named functions, it uses the same right-to-left rule as APL. E.g., `exp sin log x` is evaluated as `exp (sin (log (x)))`. Since APL has far more primitive functions represented by graphic symbols, any hierarchy covering them all would be both arbitrary and impossible to remember. Instead, APL gives *all* functions the same priority, both primitive symbols and named functions created by the programmer, and applies the same right-to-left evaluation rule to them all.\n",
